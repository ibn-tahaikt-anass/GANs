# GANs
In this lab focused on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the Abstract Art Gallery dataset

Part 1: GAN Implementation
Architecture Definition:

Utilized PyTorch to define the Generator and Discriminator architectures for the GAN.
Implemented a custom loss function suitable for GANs.
Model Initialization and GPU Setting:

Initialized both the Generator and Discriminator models.
Configured GPU settings to leverage hardware acceleration if available.
Data Loading:

Configured a data loader to efficiently load and preprocess the Abstract Art Gallery dataset.
Training Setup:

Defined optimizers for both Generator and Discriminator.
Initiated the training process for the GAN, ensuring proper convergence and stability.
Part 2: Model Evaluation
Plotting Losses:

Evaluated the GAN model by plotting losses for both the Generator and Discriminator during training.
Monitored key metrics such as adversarial and generator losses to assess the model's performance.
Analysis and Conclusions:

Derived insights from loss plots to understand the dynamics of the GAN training.
Analyzed the interplay between the Generator and Discriminator, identifying potential challenges or successes.
Part 3: Data Generation and Quality Comparison
Generating New Data:

Used the trained Generator to generate new abstract art images.
Quality Comparison:

Compared the quality of generated images to the original ones from the dataset.
Assessed the diversity, creativity, and realism of the generated artworks.
In summary, the participant gained practical experience in implementing a GAN using PyTorch, configuring data loading, and training the model. Through the evaluation of losses and the generation of new data, insights were obtained regarding the model's learning dynamics and its ability to create novel and high-quality content. This lab provided valuable hands-on experience in the application of GANs to generate art in an abstract context.
